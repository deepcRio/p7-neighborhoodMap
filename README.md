Udacity - Project 7 - Neighbourhood Map
	This app utilizes the Google Map API, Instagram API, & Knockout.js

#Description
============
This application displays a Google Map of Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro and listing of "Bars" within the Ipanema area.
The application is self contained. This was one of the projects
in the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. The project allowed students to apply the concepts learned in the Intro to AJAX and JavaScript Design Patterns classes.

#Run The App
===========
Place the contents of this repository in a directory and open the index.html file in a web browser.

#Functionality
=============
* The Application will load "Bar" locations, as well as the Google rating, into a map of the area.  The Google location type = 'bar' is used and search radius of 1000 meters.
* Each location will be represented by a marker on the map.
You can click on any of these markers to display a window of details on the selected location, which will include Name, Address and if the location is currently open.
* Both the List (with scroll bar) and the marker are clickable to focus on that particular location and will load Recent Instagrams Images with tags for the location into a horizontally scrollable bar at the bottom.
* For mobile use, there is a 'collapse' toggle button on the upper-right corner of the search list.  The 'collapse' Toggle will hide the search list for use on smaller screens.  


#Searching
=========
* A Search Bar is provided to filter out results and display only relevant locations into a list.
* To filter the list, enter the search term and press enter. If any part of the term appears in the name or address of the location it is returned in a filtered list. To reset the list, Clear the contents of the filter box and hit enter.
* Typing in the search box will limit the results in both the map markers as well as the list of locations.
* Clearing out the typed information in the search box will return all available markers.
